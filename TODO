Switch from custom img to array to Tensorflow's image to array.
Do proper shuffling on the data.
Tune the training model.
Write a parser in order to actually run as a program and not
just some blob.
Maybe add normalization?
Define inputs?
Define a custom model?
Define custom model training?
Implement model saving and model loading, preferably, as an
argument to the parser as well.
